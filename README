Watch Me lets you share a view of your screen with anyone. It does this by running
a VNC server (x11vnc) on the initiator machine, and running a VNC client (based on
gtk-vnc-python) on the client.

Watch Me depends on gtk-vnc-python and x11vnc.  Copies of these programs are included
in the bundle; however, for maximum compatibility, you should install these programs
using your system's package manager.
